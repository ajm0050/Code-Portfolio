# Code-Portfolio
Here I have uploaded a few recent programming assignment submissions.

The CS370 Project 1 was for my Intro to Computer Networks and is a client/server messenger program combo. This java program used a socket connections and a multithreading. The server is first started and clients launch and establish a socket connection. Both client and server utilize multithreading for simultaneous message listening and sending. Multiple clients can connect to the server and send messages to a target client.

The CS370 Extra Credit project was similar to Project 1, but instead of using a socket connection, the server sent out a scrambled message using multicast packets in a random order and the client was left to rearrange them into the proper order. Only the client utilizes mutlithreading for this project and only the server can send messages. Mutlithreading was employed on the client to allow simultaneous message listening and user program control. This rar file contains two mp4 video demonstrations along side a pdf with screenshots.

The CS453 project contains a client/server application utilizing JAX-WS architecture. The two servers use JAX-WS Endpoint publishing to host door and window monitoring for a theoretical building. The client then establishes an connection and provides a shell to view or change sensor values (for demonstration purposes).

The CS485 project was for my Computer and Software Security and is a Vigenere Cipher program that enciphers and deciphers using a three character key and also breaks the cipher using a brute force attack. This rar file contains an mp4 video demonstration.

The FirstRubyProgram project was for my CS 424 Programming Languages class and was my first real attempt at learning a language within days and writiing a simple file parser. At the moment, I do not have the data file that was parsed, but I can obtain it.

The Senior Design Project folder contains the Team K submission for our 499 Senior Design Project, titled: "TicketLord". TicketLord is a tool to be used by Huntsville organizations to aid in managing ticket sales and payment information across many venues and shows. It is a web based application using HTML/CSS/JS client side and PHP and SQLite3 server side. The initial project prompt can be found in "P02_TicketReservations.docx" and the final documentation detailing requirements, architecture, testing, and a GUI walkthrough can be found in  "CS499FinalDocument.pdf". If you wish to experience a live demonstration and website, please contact Alex at ajmartin2010@gmail.com. For more information, a README.txt can be found within the .rar along with the source code and other doucmentation.
