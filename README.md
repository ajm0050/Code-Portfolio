Here I have uploaded a few recent programming assignment submissions.
The CS370 project was for my Intro to Computer Networks and is a client/server messenger program combo.
The CS485 project was for my Computer and Software Security and is a Vigenere Cipher program that enciphers and deciphers using a three character key and also breaks the cipher using a brute force attack.
The FirstRubyProgram project was for my CS 424 Programming Languages class and was my first real attempt at learning a language within days and writiing a simple file parser. At the moment, I do not have the data file that was parsed, but I can obtain it.
