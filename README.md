# Code-Portfolio
Here I have uploaded a few recent programming assignment submissions.
The CS370 project was for my Intro to Computer Networks and is a client/server messenger program combo.
The CS485 project was for my Computer and Software Security and is a Vigenere Cipher program that enciphers and deciphers using a three character key and also breaks the cipher using a brute force attack.
The FirstRubyProgram project was for my CS 424 Programming Languages class and was my first real attempt at learning a language within days and writiing a simple file parser. At the moment, I do not have the data file that was parsed, but I can obtain it.
The Senior Design Project folder contains the Team K submission for our 499 Senior Design Project, titled: "TicketLord". TicketLord is a tool to be used by Huntsville organizations to aid in managing ticket sales and payment information across many venues and shows. It is a web based application using HTML/CSS/JS client side and PHP and SQLite3 server side. The initial project prompt can be found in "P02_TicketReservations.docx" and the final documentation detailing requirements, architecture, testing, and a GUI walkthrough can be found in  "CS499FinalDocument.pdf". If you wish to experience a live demonstration and website, please contact Alex at ajmartin2010@gmail.com. For more information, a README.txt can be found within the .rar along with the source code and other doucmentation.
